    How to produce sequence diagrams with Seqdiag GUI
</H2>

<p> This application is based on the package <a
    href='http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html'>seqdiag</a>, where you
may find more information. This help is only meant to get you started producing
sequence diagrams... </p>

<p> The first diagram you see when you start the application is an example of
how you can define your own diagrams. The syntax is very similar to GraphViz:
you name a series of entities and link them with arrows either in left-to-right
direction (<tt>'-&gt;'</tt>) or right-to-left direction (<tt>'&lt;-'</tt>) </p>

<p> In the example there are three entities: browser, webserver and database.
The first message goes from the browser to the webserver. It has a solid stroke
because we have written a single '-' in its definition.  The answer from the
webserver is dashed because we have written two '--' in its definition.  </p>

<p> Both messages can be merged into one single 'get and return' ensemble by
writing an equals sign ('=') in the first line, and deleting the secon line.
After editing the text, you have to press the 'Evaluate' button to see the
changes. Try this now. </p>

<p> If everything went OK, you saw no changes! In case something went bad, you
will see a red background on the sequence diagram image, and a bad status
message on the application's status bar. Try to undo your changes; if
everything fails, you can always re-start the application and start from the
beginning. </p>

<p> Let us say you want to add a new clarifying label to the response from the
database. You can do so by changing the line
<br/> <tt>webserver &lt;-- database;</tt> <br/>
to the following:
<br/> <tt>webserver &lt;-- database [label = "1 comment more"];</tt> <br/>
and pressing the Evaluate button. </p>

<p> Let us also introduce a new entity into the diagram. Locate the line where
the browser posts a new comment:
<br/><tt>browser -&gt; webserver [label = "POST /blog/comment"];</tt><br/>
and add two new lines under it:
<br/><tt>webserver -&gt; adserver;</tt><br/>
<br/><tt>webserver &lt;-- adserver [label = 'Lots of ads'];</tt><br/>
</p>

<p> You may have to resize the window to fit the new image. </p>

<p> When you are happy with your sequence diagram, you may save it by pressing
the 'Save' button and selecting a directory and filename on your disk. </p>

<p> Happy diagraming! </p>
